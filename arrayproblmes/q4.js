//Given an array of integers, find the minimum number of moves required 
//to make all elements equal, where a move is defined as incrementing n - 1 elements
// by 1, where n is the length of the array. For example, given the array [1, 2, 3], 
//the minimum number of moves required is 3, since you can increment the first two elements by 1
// each and the last element by 2 to make all elements equal to 3.

const minimum = (arr)=>{
    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length/2)
    for(let i=mid ; i <arr.length ; i++ ){
        while()
    }
