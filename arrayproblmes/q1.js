// You are given an array of integers of size N â€“ 1 ranging from 1 to N. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the array. The task is to find the missing number in the series.
// (Nesting of loop and predefined functions are not allowed)

// Eg: Input = [3, 1, 2, 6, 4]
// Output = 5
